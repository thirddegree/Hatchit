Graphics code goes onto the HatchitGraphics page for instance.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to submit a Pull Request it's probably best to clone this repo and follow the build instructions to get a working copy. Then fork the repo that you'd like to contribute code to and modify your .gitconfig file to point to your fork. Then you can edit, test and push all you'd like before submitting a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Build instructions\r\n\r\nThis is subject to change and may not be complete or entirely accurate!\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\nAll testing and development so far has been done on Ubuntu 16.04 XENIAL\r\n\r\nInstall the following dependencies:\r\n* GCC (minimum required version. 5.0) -- for C++11/14 support\r\n* CMake\r\n* GLFW3\r\n* Bullet3\r\n* Assimp\r\n* TinyXML2\r\n* Python 3.5 (with pip and virtualenv)\r\n* Vulkan SDK \t(For Vulkan Support)\r\n\r\nThen follow these simple directions:\r\n* Clone down the repo with `git clone --recursive http://github.com/thirddegree/Hatchit`\r\n* Make a build dir (e.g. mkdir build)\r\n* cd into build/ and run cmake ..\r\n* Now just run make to build Hatchit\r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\nThis is a bit more of a pain. All dependencies are submodules in the Third Party\r\ndirectory and will need to be built before you build Hatchit.\r\n\r\nAll testing and development has been done on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2015\r\n\r\n##### Pre-Build\r\nWe recommend using some sort of cmd replacement in Windows such as cmder or some sort of bash shell\r\n* Install CMake and make sure it is in your path\r\n* Make sure that you can run `msbuild.exe` from your shell. If it's not there try running the `vcvarsall.bat` file located at `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\vcvarsall.bat` for Visual Studio 2015\r\n* Clone down the repo with `git clone --recursive http://github.com/thirddegree/Hatchit`\r\n\r\nTo build with Vulkan support you MUST have installed:\r\n* Vulkan SDK\r\n* Vulkan supported drivers!\r\n\r\nThe build system requires that you have a working Python 3.5 installation.\r\n\r\n##### Third Party\r\nNext up is building all the dependencies. This should only have to be done once for your machine. After this you won't have to worry about `vcvarsall.bat` but you will need CMake.\r\n\r\n* Run the `setup.bat` file. This should configure AND BUILD all your dependencies\r\n\r\n##### Hatchit\r\nThis is the easy part!\r\n\r\n* `cd` into `build\r\n* Open the Hatchit.sln solution file or execute it with MSBuild.exe to build all targets\r\n",
